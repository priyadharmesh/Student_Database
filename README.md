# Student_Database
JSON Handling and TCP Communication

Type: Academic Project
Skills: Advanced C++, JSON Handling, TCP Communication
Description: In this project, I developed a robust student database management system using advanced C++ and JSON for data storage. 
The system was designed to handle student records efficiently, offering functionalities such as adding, updating, deleting, and querying student information. 
JSON was chosen for its flexibility in representing complex data structures, allowing for easy manipulation and storage of student data.
Additionally, the system included TCP communication capabilities, enabling multiple users to connect to the database simultaneously over a network.
This feature facilitated real-time data access and updates, making the system highly responsive and user-friendly. 
This project required a deep understanding of data structures, network programming, and database management, providing a comprehensive learning experience in building scalable and efficient software systems.
